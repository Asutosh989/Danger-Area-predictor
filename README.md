# Danger Area Predictor

[** The Global Terrorism Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd) provides us with the information with all the Terrorist Attacks all over world between 1970-2016. It gives very detailed information about the attack like Date, Place, Country, City, Region, Attacktype, Target of Terrorists and Terrorist organizations involved.

Here our aim is to take the GPS location of the user and alert him if he is in a *Danger Area* or in a *Safe area*, and if he is in a danger area, then which country and what is the nearby danger prone area.
